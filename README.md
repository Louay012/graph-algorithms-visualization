## 📌 Features

- Visual step-by-step execution of Dijkstra's algorithm
- Graph animation with:
  - Current node in orange
  - Tree edges in red
  - Final shortest path in green
- Dynamic distance table updated at each step
- Multiple predefined graphs including:
  - Manual graph
  - Tree graph
  - Graph with cycles
  - Random generated graph
  - Disconnected graph
  - Single path graph
  - Complete graph
  - Equal weight cycle grap

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx pillow
```
then run it 
-> This will generate several .gif files (one per graph type) in the current directory.
